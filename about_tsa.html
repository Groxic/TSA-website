    <h3 class="text-center">Motto</h3>

	<h3 class="text-center">Creed</h3>
	<p class="centered std-well-just">I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe that there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.   I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and my mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief of God, and my fellow Americans.</p>
