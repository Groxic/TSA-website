	<h1>About MAST</h1>
	<h3>Technology and Engineering Classes</h3>
	<ul class="centered std-well-just">
	<li><h3>APCSP</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">“AP Computer Science Principles offers a multidisciplinary approach to teaching the underlying principles of computation. The course will introduce students to the creative aspects of programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity concerns, and computing impacts.” -CollegeBoard</p></li>
	<li><h3>APSCA</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">“The design and implementation of computer programs to solve problems involve skills that are fundamental to the study of computer science. This includes the development and analysis of algorithms and fundamental data structures, and the use of logic and formal methods.” -CollegeBoard</p></li>
	<li><h3>Engineering I, II, and III</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">Students are able to develop their knowledge in CAD, robotics, and engineering design principles.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Dual Enrollment Engineering</h3></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Clubs</h3>
	<ul class="centered std-well-just">
	<li><h3>Robotics</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">Mecha Makos Robotics allows students to participate in a variety of engineering and technology related competitions. The diverse range of activities available include but are not limited to designing and constructing robots.</p></li>
	<li><h3>MIT Launch</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">As described by Launch X, "Our club's program expands the reach of high school entrepreneurship to students and schools everywhere. We hand our curriculum off to motivated and forward-thinking teens so you can build a startup throughout the school year, supported by our detailed programming, resources, and mentor-ship. This is not a business plan constitution. Your task is to create a real startup- to solve a real need in a differentiated way. The focus is on taking action, learning from results, and making changes to improve your chances of success."</p></li>
