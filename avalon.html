	<ol class="centered std-well-just">
	<p>Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics were created to address the negative concerns of robots:</p>
	<li>&nbsp A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
	<li>&nbsp A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
	<li>&nbsp A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="text-center">Company Name and Purpose</h3>
	<div class="centered std-well-just">
	<p>Avalon</p>
	<p>We build AI Robots to promote education and business.</p>
	</div>
	<h3 class="text-center">What is Avalon?</h3>
	<div class="centered std-well-just">
	<p>Avalon is a learning and training platform that recommends a custom curriculum based on a myriad of personalized questions and, if applicable, previously taken courses.  It uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP). It also uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for course classification and an RNN for the recommendation system. This allows for courses to be automatically managed and categorized by the artificial intelligence. Avalon would act as a teaching assistant, working alongside teachers and trainers to individually optimize education for students. Avalon is an egg shaped robot that travels on wheels. Avalon is equipped with cameras, microphones, speakers, and a wifi adaptor. It connects to the host’s network so it can easily communicate with many students at the same time.</p>
    </div>
	<h3 class="text-center">Applications</h3>
	<ul class="centered std-well-just">
	<li>Education:</li>
	<p>Avalon recommends classes which will keep students engaged. In addition, the course platform prevents students from being distracted by other sites.</p>
	<li>Business:</li>
	<p>Avalon can be used to train new employees for job specific work, therefore the company will not need to waste resources and time having another employee train them.</p>
	<li>Recreational:</li>
	<p>Avalon’s custom course recommendations make learning fun for anyone, making it easy for people to learn in their free time.</p>
	<li>Research:</li>
	<p>The data gathered by avalon can be used in research for studies regarding popular interests, as well as what subjects different groups of people are interested in.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="text-center">Overview</h3>
	<ul class="centered std-well-just">
	<li><h3>Costs & How To Purchase</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">Avalon must be purchased online through a separate website. We accept various forms of cryptocurrency, as well as Euro and USD. We offer discount for schools and school districts. Each customizable bot is $3,000 USD due to high costs of production and development.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Benefits</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">Avalon creates an easier learning environment that will keep learners engaged. We hope that through Avalon we can create a more educated and intellectually stimulated, and promote learning even after the completion of one’s education. We hope that through Avalon, education can become more accessible.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Safety</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">All of our users are instantly made anonymous in our system, and any data gathered will only be used for the sake of science. We promise not to sell the preferences of any individual to marketing or commercial companies. In addition, each Avalon is equipped with facial recognition software so that each student’s courses and progress is private to them alone, this allows for multiple profiles on a single bot.  The course progress is accessible online, but each profile can only be accessed with facial recognition.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Liabilities</h3><p class="centered std-well-just">We at Avalon are not liable for any hardware/software malfunctions past the one-year warranty or any virus development. We also take no responsibility to any damage due to neglect or abuse.</p></li>
